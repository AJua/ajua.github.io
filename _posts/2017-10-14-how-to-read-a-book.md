# Chapter 1. The activity and art the reading

reader: understand the world from the written world

reading VS radio & TV

## Active Reading

The median of reading could be newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, articles,
tracts, AD, blog, forum, 

> when we contrast active with passive reading, our purpose is, first, to call
> attention to the fact that reading can be more or less active, and second, to
> point out the more active the reading the better.

> the reader or listener is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball. 

to gain the maximun from the writer or speaker he/she should put effort as well.
both are active and need to put effort into it

> The art of catching is the skill of catching every kind of pitch-fast balls
> and curves, changeups and knucklers. Similarly, the art of reading is the
> skill of catching every sort of communication as well as possible.  

> The ball is a simple unit. It is either completely caught or not.  A piece of
> writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less
> completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the
> whole of it.

這是用傳接球來比喻閱讀不適合的地方

## The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding

> the art of reading: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but
> the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates
> itself by the power of its own operations.(There is one kind of situation in
> which it is appropriate to ask for outside help in reading a difficult book.
> This exception is discussed in Chapter 18). The mind passes from understanding
> less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen
> are the various acts that constitute the art of reading.

> by "learning" is meant understanding more, not remembering more information
> that has the same degree of intelligibility as other information you already
> possess.  

> What are the conditions under which this kind of reading -reading for
> understanding-takes place? There are two. First, there is initial inequality
> in understanding. The writer must be "superior" to the reader in
> understanding, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he
> possesses and his potential readers lack. Second, the reader must be able to
> overcome this inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always
> approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is
> approached, clarity of communication is achieved.  In short, we can learn only
> from our "betters."

我們只能夠從比我們更好的對象學習嗎?

## Reading as learning: The difference between learning by Instruction and
learning by Discovery

> To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened
> is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its
> connections are with other facts, in what respects it is the same, in what
> respects it is different, and so forth.  

learning by Instruction(aided discovery): 從老師學習。

learning by Discovery(unaided discovery):
不藉由第三人, 自己觀察研究學習到新的知識。

> It would be a mistake to suppose that discovery is active learning and
> instruction passive. There is no inactive learning, just as there is no
> inactive reading.

> they suppose reading and listening to be relatively effortless. It is probably
> true that one does less thinking when one reads for information or
> entertainment than when one is undertaking to discover something.  

## Terms

reading, learning, thinking

learning includes thinking, sense, imagination, observe, remember (keenness of
observation, readily avilable memory, range of imagination, intllect trained in
analysis and reflection)

## Present and Absent Teachers

> there is good reason to place primary emphasis on reading, and let listening
> become a secondary concern.

聽課是跟老師學習, 聽的過程有問題可以直接問老師；而閱讀是從書的內容學習, 閱讀過程有問題, 書不會回答, 只能靠自己思考跟分析, 這個過程是很接近真實世界的。

## Chapter notes

The goal of reading are entertainment, information, and understanding.  The
different. Different goal will need different reading approach.
