---
### Nvidia 顯示卡驅動程式

參考  [NVIDIA GeForce Driver Installation on Debian Jessie Linux 8 64bit](https://linuxconfig.org/nvidia-geforce-driver-installation-on-debian-jessie-linux-8-64bit) ，

Add non-free to Debian repository

```sh
deb http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
```

Update the repository and install

```sh
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install nvidia-driver
$ apt-get install nvidia-xconfig
$ nvidia-xconfig
```

### Docker resolve host not found


```sh
$ vim /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add name dns server to the top

```sh
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

### Steam dependencies

```sh
$ apt-get install '^libc6.*' 
$ vim /etc/apt/sources.list
$ dpkg --add-architecture i386
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386
$ apt-get install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386

```

### DualBootWindows10 

Windows 10 was installed first on a non-formated disk using a non-UEFI BIOS.

A partition table (type msdos) and a partition for Windows were created manually during the installation of Windows. Windows automatically created a "System Reserved" partition (/dev/sda1) used for booting. Windows was installed into the second partition (/dev/sda2). Debian was installed into the third partition (/dev/sda3).

Problem: The GRUB entry created for Windows by the os-prober is wrong (e.g., has the wrong name).
Solution: Disable os-prober create a custom GRUB menu entry for Windows.
