Tips

1. [task due] Don't overdo this though, as a delay might force you to spend too much time reorganizing everything.
2. [task priority] But don't fall into the trap of shifting the priorities too often, as you'll waste a lot of time.
3. [task description] Try not to have large, long-term tasks that will sit on your list forever. It can be very satisfying and motivating to complete tasks, so create more, but smaller, tasks. Don't have a 'learn Japanese' task, instead have a 'Complete chapter 1' task instead, it's more readily achievable, and you can more easily see progress, which can be motivating.
